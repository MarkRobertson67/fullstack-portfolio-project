            I'm currently learning Express, having already studied React, JavaScript, HTML & CSS and I am training to become a software engineer so that I can solve real-world problems.  When I'm not coding, I enjoy movies, watching Formula 1 racing, music, travel and playing with my German Shepherd.
            
            I would very much enjoy working for a start-up (as I have start-up experience) or even a large financial firm, as my experience up until Pursuit has been in the financial markets.`,
